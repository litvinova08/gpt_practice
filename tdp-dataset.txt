          What is the likelihood of employment with an MBA?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          A survey of recent Swinburne Online graduates revealed that 90 per cent of Business alumni were employed full-time. This comes as no surprise as the 2021 GMAC Corporate Recruiters Survey revealed that worldwide, 91 per cent of recruiters planned to hire MBAs that year, and that demand for graduate management talent has now returned to pre-pandemic levels.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          Is there a pay increase between undergraduate and MBA students?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          In 2020, the Australian Government Department of Education, Skills and Employment Graduate Outcomes Survey found that working professionals without a postgraduate degree received a median salary of $64,000 per year, while those with a postgraduate degree in addition to their undergrad degree earned on average $98,000 per year. The Australian Financial Review reported in its 2019 MBA Rankings that Australian MBA graduates see an average salary increase of 28 per cent to reach $157,000 within three years of completing their course. 
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          Why should I choose Swinburne over different providers? 
        
      

      
        
          A.
          Swinburne University’s MBA has a Tier-1 rating and is in the top Online MBAs in CEO Magazine’s 2022 Global Rankings. It is also accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), a globally recognised business school standard achieved by less than 5 per cent of business schools worldwide. When you complete your MBA with Swinburne Online, you will receive the same globally recognised MBA as on-campus students, without having to attend any in-person or live teaching sessions. Swinburne Online’s MBA is highly flexible, meaning that you can tailor the course content to suit your specific interests and career goals.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What quantitative value can I hope for in taking on an MBA? 
        
      

      
        
          A.
          A survey of recent Swinburne Online graduates revealed that 90 per cent of Business alumni were employed full-time. This comes as no surprise as the 2021 GMAC Corporate Recruiters Survey revealed that worldwide, 91 per cent of recruiters planned to hire MBAs that year, and that demand for graduate management talent has now returned to pre-pandemic levels. With a new job title, you can expect an increased salary. Australian Financial Review reported in its 2019 MBA Rankings that Australian MBA graduates see an average salary increase of 28 per cent to reach $157,000 within three years of completing their course. 
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          Is STARS paid?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          All students enrolled into the STARS program will receive a $900 Stipend to assist with the cost of their study or professional placement.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          Are STARS placements extra placements or part of my course?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          The STARS professional placements are part of the required professional placements in your course. They are not extra placements.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          Can I complete my two STARS placements in the school that I am doing Permission To Teach (PTT) work? The school fits the low-socioeconomic criteria and have said they would be happy for me do my STARS placements there. 
        
      

      
        
          A.
          You will be able to complete your final two placements through the STARS program at your school. You will also be able to continue with PTT across the year. For example, it may be that you have a split, perhaps three days in STARS and two days in PTT. The STARS part would need to be supervised and would also allow you to do the GTPA (final placement assessment). After you have submitted your application for the STARS program, please reach out to Jade on this email address: edpartnerships@swinburneonline.com and she will be able to assist you in negotiating this with your school.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          When Swinburne matches the student to the placement school, what is the criteria for travel expectations, will Swinburne match me to somewhere within a reasonable distance from my home or could it be anywhere in regional/rural Victoria?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          Swinburne will try to match you to a school as close as possible to your usual place of residence. The maximum travel time from your home to the school will be 90 minutes however, every endeavour will be made to try to ensure it is less than this.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          When do the STARS Canvas modules open? Would I be able to have access to them at the start of the teaching period as I'd like to work on the STARS module before placement?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          The STARS modules remain open all the time, so you will be able to complete the module work at a time that suits you. There are five modules, each with approximately 1.5–2 hours of reading and activities. Allow 7.5–10 hours in total to complete the STARS modules.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What will I receive at completion of this program?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          You will receive a certificate of completion outlining your completion of the program. This certificate will be a valuable addition to your resume when applying for graduate teaching positions.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          Will there be any financial support for travel or accommodation to undertake a placement in regional or remote Victoria? 
        
      

      
        
          A.
          No, all costs associated with travel or accommodation will be incurred by the pre-service teacher. We hope to match pre-service teachers with a school in their area. If you are a successful applicant, and there may be travel involved for you to get to the school. We will discuss with you the situation before matching you to the school.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          I have secured a placement in a school setting that is not a regional, remote or low socioeconomic school. If I am successful in my application will you help me change to a STARS-approved school setting? 
        
      

      
        
          A.
          We will be open to discuss this with you further.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          I am a Master of Teaching (Secondary) student applying for the STARS program. Does it matter the year level of placement or my Specialist Teaching Area? 
        
      

      
        
          A.
          No, we will work with the schools upon a successful application.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What if I have already organised my placement/s? Can I still participate in the program?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          Provided your secured placement is in regional, rural or low socioeconomic Victorian school and you have been successful in your STARS application, Swinburne can support negotiations with your placement setting to ascertain if they wish to be part of the program.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          How do I organise a placement in a STARS-approved school setting? 
        
      

      
        
          A.
          Victorian Department of Education and Training (DET) will be supporting Swinburne to access and source the placement schools on your behalf.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What schools can I do my placement in as part of the STARS program?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          The STARS program placement schools can be in regional and rural or low socioeconomic schools in Victoria that will be selected by Swinburne, with pre-service teachers matched to schools.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          How many practicums will I need to complete during the STARS program? 
        
      

      
        
          A.
          During the year the program runs (mid-year 2022 to mid-year 2023), you must undertake both remaining placements (or the one remaining), in your course during this time.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          How will the STARS program fit in with my current units of study?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          This program will run alongside your current units of study.

You will be enrolled into a STARS program unit. The unit is at no cost to you.
Introductions to the STARS program are planned to commence in late May/early June.

The STARS unit will commence from June.

There are five modules of additional study and activities supported by academic teacher mentors.
Engagement with the modules will be periodic, and is planned to occur between June to October 2022.

The workload per module is anticipated to be approximately 10 hours over two to three weeks for each module. 

More specific details will be provided to successful applicants.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
           How many pre-service teachers can partake in the STARS program for 2022–2023 year?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          This opportunity is only open to 75 students and therefore a rigorous selection process will take place.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          When does the STARS program commence? 
        
      

      
        
          A.
          The STARS program commences mid-year 2022 (TP2, Q3).
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What if I want to continue studying after 1 December 2020?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          You can.  If you wish to continue studying the course after 1 December 2020, you will be eligible for a Commonwealth Supported Place for the rest of your studies.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          Can I enrol in a Professional Certificate?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          Not exactly. The federal government is providing discounts for students who are enrolled in qualifications recognised by the Australian Qualification Framework. This means, to ensure you receive the discounted course fee, you need to enrol in at least a graduate certificate level qualification. If you only complete the first two units, Swinburne is ensuring that you still receive a qualification by awarding you a professional certificate.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What is a Professional Certificate?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          Professional Certificates are generally the first two units of a Graduate or Undergraduate Certificate and provide you with solid introductory knowledge, as well as contributing to the higher degree should you wish to continue studying later. Professional Certificates are a good way of upskilling quickly and providing you with an opportunity to start your education journey at a discounted fee.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What if I only want to complete two units?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          If you enrol in the Graduate Certificate, you can choose to complete your studies after the first two units and exit with a University-accredited Professional Certificate.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          Can I obtain help to defer payment?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          Yes, students can defer their payment though a HECS-HELP loan.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          How do I ensure I’m enrolled with a discounted fee?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          Your discounted fee will be applied at the time of enrolment.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          Why are these courses discounted?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          Swinburne University has worked with the Federal Government to provide short, focused online courses to workers displaced by the COVID-19 crisis. These courses have been significantly discounted to allow you to complete study during the next 6 months and support your future employment opportunities.

          Q.
          Is the whole course discounted?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          Units you complete prior to 1 December are discounted, so this includes the two units available in Teaching Period 2, 2020. If you continue studying following Teaching Period 2, you can do so with a Commonwealth Supported Place, rather than the standard full fee unit fee.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          Will you be offering courses as part of the government’s higher education relief package?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          Yes, we will be offering a range of courses as part of this initiative. Read more about our priority course program.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          Will I receive the same qualification as an on-campus student?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          When students graduate from our courses, they will receive the same accredited qualification as a Swinburne University of Technology on-campus student. The graduation certificate awarded will also be the same. Our courses and learning outcomes are the same as Swinburne University of Technology’s, but we adapt the material and its delivery to enable students to enjoy the most engaging online environment.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          Will I receive credit for my previous studies?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          We can potentially offer students unit exemptions for our undergraduate courses, based on diploma and higher education qualifications undertaken within the last 10 years.


Previous studies don’t necessarily need to be related to the field you’re looking to pursue with us to make you eligible for exemptions. We can also award unit exemptions towards our postgraduate courses, where previously completed studies are considered academically equivalent (i.e. postgraduate level) and have been completed within the last 10 years.


TAFE students may be eligible to receive credit for previous study and work experience. If you’ve completed units or certificates at another recognised institute or training organisation, you may be able to apply for a credit transfer. Alternatively, if you have significant work experience related to your studies, you can apply to have this recognised through recognition of prior learning.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          Will I need to be screened to work with children?

          You must read the VET Student Loans Information Booklet before applying for a loan. A VET student loan results in a HELP debt that continues to be a debt due to the government until it is repaid. You will start repaying the loan when you reach the minimum repayment threshold.

The rate at which you repay the loan is based on your income, as you earn more you will repay a higher percentage of your taxable income towards your loan. Check the Study Assist website to find out more. We encourage you to seek independent financial advice to be sure a VET Student Loan is right for you.

The program is called ULANZ and more information is available here: ULANZ website

Swinburne Online students receive the same qualification as students at Swinburne University of Technology, an internationally ranked university with 30,000 students across its Melbourne and overseas campuses.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What is the difference between a degree and a diploma?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          Offered by universities, TAFEs, Registered Training Organisations and Community Education Centres, a diploma is a practical qualification, while a degree is typically offered by universities and encompasses more academic courses. For more information about the different qualifications, visit our Online Courses page.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What is TAFE?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          Technical and Further Education (TAFE) is the term used to describe certain state-administered education institutions. Such institutions provide Vocational Education and Training (VET) and qualifying courses under the National Training System, Australian Qualifications Framework and Australian Quality Training Network.

A Registered Training Organisation (RTO) is an organisation accredited by the Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA) which is the national regulator for Australia’s vocational education and training sector. ASQA regulates courses and training providers to ensure nationally approved quality standards are met.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What is Postgraduate Study?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          Postgraduate study is a term generally used to describe tertiary education courses available to students who have already completed a bachelor degree or have significant relevant work experience. Postgraduate study takes the form of either coursework or research.

Coursework consists of a program of academic study to achieve one or more of the following:

 	Graduate Certificate
 	Graduate Diploma
 	Postgraduate Diploma
 	Master by Coursework
 	Professional Master
 	Professional Doctorate

Taking a research approach to postgraduate study entails conducting research and providing a thesis to earn a:

 	Master by Research or
 	Doctor of Philosophy (PhD).

        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What is online education?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          Online education utilises breakthrough web technologies to deliver academic courses. When undertaking online study, students may use a range of tools such as webinars, videos, chat sessions and e-texts to deliver content.

Assessments can be undertaken synchronously or asynchronously. Synchronous learning refers to situations where online participation from a student is required at a certain time. This may involve a live discussion session with an online tutor, or a presentation which is only available to be viewed at that time. Asynchronous learning involves study where the event is not in a live format, but it may still have a loose timeframe, for example: an assessment that will be accessible at any time over a week long period. Both of these learning styles are utilised to their optimum when studying with Swinburne Online.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What is Higher Education?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          Higher education encompasses Bachelor level degrees and above and is offered by universities. Whether you’re entering or re-entering the workforce, changing career paths or simply want to broaden your expertise, higher education will help you achieve your career goals with courses ranging from bachelor degrees, masters degrees, doctorates and more. Each course requires different commitments in terms of time, cost and pre-requisite or foundation study or experience.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What is HECS-HELP?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          The HECS‑HELP scheme can benefit an undergraduate domestic student (for example an Australian citizen studying a Bachelor degree at Swinburne Online) as a student loan. Instead of paying upfront, HECS-HELP is how eligible students can pay their student contribution amount.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What is Distance Education?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          Distance education (sometimes known as learning by correspondence) is a broad term that describes education delivered to a student who is in a separate location to the source of the academic content. This method of education has been around since the 1800s and in comparison with online education, which is offered by Swinburne Online, it is often viewed by professionals as outdated. The mode of delivery traditionally involves sending the course materials and assessments back and forth between the student and learning institution in hard copy. Many distance education programs require the student to attend classes or workshops on campus at some stage during the semester.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What is an Honours Degree?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          You can graduate with honours from a Bachelor Degree by undertaking an additional year of study, generally requiring you to complete a research project and submit a thesis, thereby positioning you for further research studies.

          What is a virtual classroom?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          For students studying a degree, a virtual classroom is the online space where your learning will take place. You’ll participate in interactive learning activities, access online reading, watch instructional videos and interact with your fellow students. Plus, class sizes are kept small so you get the personalised support you need.

          Q.
          What is a specialisation?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          A specialisation is a prescribed set of units within an area. Specialising in a second discipline, particularly one that complements your major, can complement your qualiﬁcation and employment prospects. However, a specialisation is an area of interest not an accredited major.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What is a pre-requisite?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          A pre-requisite subject is a subject or sequence of subjects which must be completed before choosing a subsequent unit or course. For example, an undergraduate student cannot choose postgraduate units at Swinburne Online.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What is a PhD?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          A Doctor of Philosophy, or PhD, is a globally recognised qualification that’s considered the highest postgraduate achievement an individual can earn. To be awarded with a PhD, you must select a specific subject within your chosen field, carry out extensive and original research and submit a substantial thesis on your findings. Your thesis will be assessed by external examiners and will be judged on the quality of original research and contribution to the knowledge of the subject.

You’ll be required to commit to three or four years of full-time study (or part-time equivalent) and will be supervised by academic staff members. Once you graduate, you’ll be eligible to teach in your chosen field at a university level or work in a specialised position.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What is a Masters Degree?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          A Masters Degree allows you to become a specialist in your chosen field. Typically students are required you to demonstrate a high-order overview of a specific field of study or area of professional practice. When you graduate, you’ll possess advanced knowledge of a specialised body of theoretical and applied topics, high order skills in analysis, critical evaluation, or professional application; and the ability to solve complex problems and think rigorously and independently. You will generally be required to undertake academic coursework and in some cases, preparation for professional practice.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What is a major unit?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          A major unit refers to what ‘specialisation’ you would like to focus on within your degree. For example, as a Bachelor of Business Administration student, you may wish to major in a specialisation area such as marketing. For current students, more information can be found in the Study Resources section of our Student Portal.

          What is a Graduate Diploma?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          A Graduate Diploma will allow you to complete specialisation studies in a smaller amount of time and at a reduced cost of a Masters degree. Most of the time you will also have the option of transferring to a masters degree in the same topic. Once you complete your graduate diploma, you’ll have advanced knowledge and skills for professional, highly skilled work or further learning.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What is a Graduate Certificate?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          Completing a Graduate Certificate will help you upgrade your qualifications or give you advanced practical skills required in specialist industries. If you haven’t earned a bachelor degree, many programs may allow you entry provided you have sufficient relevant work experience in your chosen field. Graduate Certificates generally require a commitment of six months full-time study, or an equivalent part-time commitment.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What is a Grade Point Average (GPA)?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          A GPA is a calculation for higher education results. There are two GPA scales commonly used in Australia and overseas, the four-point and the seven-point scale. These scales differ in the grade points that they allocate to each grade but the method of calculation is the same. Swinburne uses a four-point method. To find out how to calculate a GPA visit our Grade Point Average page.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What is a good option for upskilling during this time?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          The best study option for you will depend on your current level of education, as well as the amount of available time you have to commit. For those looking to step up and earn a promotion or just upskill in general, a short course might be the best choice.

A Graduate Certificate is also a good option for anyone looking to be educated over a short period of time.

          Q.
          What is a Double Degree?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          A double degree is a university degree where you study two single degrees at the same time, giving you the option of specialising in two different fields. To be eligible to enrol in a double degree, you must meet all the entry requirements of both degree programs. Even though you’ll be doubling your opportunities and giving yourself more career flexibility once you graduate, a double degree generally doesn’t take double the time to complete.

In most instances, you’ll benefit from cross-crediting elective units, which will reduce your study costs and time compared to if you were studying separate bachelor degrees at different times. Usually a double degree will take four years full time study or part-time equivalent.

          What is a Diploma?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          Completing a Diploma or Advanced Diploma certificate will give you practical skills for work as well as the opportunity to progress to another qualification. At Swinburne, you’ll be taught by experienced teachers and have access to equipment used in industry to help prepare you for your future.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What is a Commonwealth Supported Place?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          The Australian Government subsidises an Australian citizen student’s education by giving them a Commonwealth supported place. By doing this they are paying part of the course fees directly to the university and the student pays the remainder. If you are a domestic undergraduate student, you are eligible for a Commonwealth supported place.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What is a Certificate?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          Certificates are the most basic qualification available to secondary school students and beyond. Offered by TAFEs, Community Education Centres and Registered Training Providers, Certificates I, II, III and IV will prepare you for employment or further education and training.

Certificate I: Will give you skills when beginning a profession or help you gain community involvement.
Certificate II: You’ll build on knowledge and skills to work in a defined context and undertake further learning.
Certificate III: You’ll learn more in-depth theoretical and practical skills for work or further learning.
Certificate IV: You’ll learn theoretical and practical skills for specialised work or further learning.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What is a Bachelor Degree?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          Bachelor degrees are offered by universities and are presented to you when you complete an undergraduate course of study. Depending on the field of study, the duration of the degree can range from three to five years of full-time study (or part-time equivalent). Most bachelor degrees are recognised worldwide. A Bachelor degree teaches you skills such as research and analytical thinking and is recognised as a higher qualification to diplomas or certificates. Where a Diploma will give you the skills you need for your job, a Bachelor will set you up for your career.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What happens if I don’t pay my fees on time?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          It is your responsibility to ensure that your enrolment is correct prior to the due date. If you do not pay your fees by the due date you may be cancelled from your degree. If you withdraw from a unit after the due date you will receive a fail result on your student record.

For TAFE students, your course won’t begin until you’ve paid your fees, or submitted your VET FEE HELP form.

          A.
          At Swinburne Online, our online education method just requires students to have access to a broadband connection! Students can log in to their online environment to access their course, whenever and wherever it is convenient for them. Traditional on-campus education requires students to attend lectures and tutorials at a venue at a given time.

Distance education often requires a number of different communication modes and can sometimes involve the sending of printed material to a student’s residence.

          What are the benefits of acquiring a Tableau certification?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          Earning an industry certification is a powerful way to demonstrate and validate your competency to the market. Tableau certified professionals enjoy advanced career prospects, higher salaries, improved job security, greater confidence and proficiency in the workplace, and skill validation.

          Q.
          What are placements?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          When you study an education degree you complete practicum units that include theory and professional experience, also called a placement. Your placement will provide you with a real-life teaching experience at an early learning centre or primary school. This will give you the chance to apply the skills you’ve learnt online, build your confidence in the classroom, and gain invaluable industry experience.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What are exemptions?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          An exemption is a credit you are given by Swinburne Online for previous study or prior learning at another institute. If you are eligible for exemptions, it can mean that you can fast-track your degree or diploma and graduate sooner. To find out if you are eligible for any exemptions, speak to one of our Course Consultants.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What are electives and why do I need to study them?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          Electives are free choice units that must be completed to meet the requirements for most of our degrees. They are included in many of our courses to give students flexibility, in terms of how they complete their degree. Their inclusion in our courses allows students to explore other subjects of interest that may not be included in the core structure of their chosen degree.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          What are core units?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          A core unit is a unit common to most degrees within a discipline. For example, all social science degrees at Swinburne Online share the same core units, regardless of which degree you are studying. Generally, core units are taken towards the start of your degree. For current students, more information can be found in the Study Resources section of our Student Portal.

          Q.
          If I have a VSL can I withdraw from my course?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          Yes. If you decide to discontinue your studies, you will need to formally withdraw from your course. To formally withdraw, please complete the self-service request form including:

 	Your full name and student number
 	The course you’re enrolled in
 	Your intent to withdraw
 	Whether you paid your fees upfront or applied for VET FEE HELP or a VET Student Loan.

Withdrawing before Census: To avoid incurring a VET FEE HELP or VET Student Loan debt (or to receive a full refund if you pay for your fees upfront) you must send your email to Swinburne Online on or before your Census date. We will inform you of your Census dates when you enrol. If you paid your fees upfront, Swinburne Online will send you a refund application form. Once this is processed you will receive a full refund within 10 business days.

Withdrawing after Census: If you withdraw from your course after your Census date, you will be automatically charged for the units you enrolled in. You won’t be able to receive a refund. If you elected for VET FEE HELP or VET Student Loan, you will incur the debt.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.

          Q.
          I’m studying a degree, will I have to sit exams?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          Exam attendance is necessary for all of our courses, other than education courses, our Bachelor of Design (Communication Design) and some media studies units. Exams are taken at specified exam centre venues in capital cities around Australia. When students reside more than 100km from an exam centre, or have any condition that would prevent them from taking exams at exam centres, they can sit an online exam.

All our international students will also be required to sit their exams online, at home using a personal computer. To find out more about exams, visit our assessments and exams page on the website.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          I’m interested in becoming a teacher. How will teaching placements work, given that your degrees are online?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          Students studying our online education courses still have to complete placements like on-campus students. In order to register to teach, graduates must have completed at least 60 days of professional placement when studying at postgraduate level and at least 80 days at undergraduate level. Professional placements can be taken anywhere in Australia, in schools that use the Australian curriculum or early childhood settings that use the Early Years Learning Framework.

          The length of your degree will largely depend on how many units you undertake per teaching period. The number of units required to complete a degree varies from qualification to qualification and you can see how many units are required to complete a particular degree on our Course Pages.

Alternatively, you can have a look at our Course Planners for more detailed information about how to manage a specific degree. As students have the option of studying between one and four units per teaching period and can change their study load throughout, each student will graduate at a different point.

If you are studying a VET course, you can personalise your program, giving you the freedom to set your own goals, choose what units you study first, and determine how long you spend on each one. So whether you want to complete your diploma in two months or over a year — you can work towards your goals at a pace that suits you.

It’s important to note that number of study hours required for each diploma does change, and you can view the specific requirements on our VET course pages.

This means not just remembering new information, but evaluating it and using it to solve problems and to come up with new ideas. Students at Swinburne Online learn with the three learning components: theory, practice and sharing. You learn your theory through the free Learning Materials, put it into practice with weekly Learning Activities and then share your learnings with other classmates in the Discussion Boards.

          Q.
          How does online study work?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          You can undertake our courses from anywhere with an internet connection, including the comfort of your own home during social isolation.

Swinburne Online takes domestic students for both degrees and TAFE diplomas from anywhere in Australia. International students are also accepted for our degrees, although some differences to their payment processes will apply.

You won’t normally have to be online at a specific time. Your course material is available for you from the beginning of each teaching period and you can work through it in the hours that suit you.

There are some live webinar sessions that run approximately once a month. These are a special opportunity for students to sign in at the same time as their tutors, normally before an assessment deadline. It gives you the chance to ask any questions relating to the assignment in real time and hear other student’s questions and thoughts. We understand that students won’t always be able to make these sessions, so they can be replayed the next day.

          A.
          When studying a degree and you are struggling with motivation, time management or simply need help with an assignment or some technical support, you can get in touch with our Student Advisors. Call 1300 937 765 from Australia, +61 3 9956 0777 for Australian citizens living overseas and 800 8001 1222 for international students, anytime between 9am – 9pm (AEST) Monday to Friday and 10am – 6pm (AEST) on weekends and public holidays – or fill out a Help Web Form to speak to one of our Student Advisors.

If you’re enrolled in a TAFE course you will have support in Canvas – your online learning environment.

There is also a discussion board where you can post questions that will be answered by a pool of industry trained teachers, waiting to help you.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          How do I repay my HELP loan?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          HECS-HELP, FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP enable eligible students to state their intention for tuition fees to be paid on their behalf by the federal government to Swinburne Online. This results in students having a loan with the Australian Tax Office that can be repaid through the tax system. Repayments for HELP loans are not required until students are earning more than a certain amount per annum.

          Applying to study with Swinburne Online is simple and one of our course consultants will be available to help you with any questions you have.

          Q.
          How do exams work?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          Exam attendance is necessary for all of our courses, other than education courses, our Bachelor of Design (Communication Design) and some media studies units. Exams are taken at specified exam centre venues in capital cities around Australia. When students reside more than 100km from an exam centre, or have any condition that would prevent them from taking exams at exam centres, they can sit an online exam. All our international students will also be required to sit their exams online, at home using a personal computer.
To find out more about exams, visit our assessments and exams page.

          You can communicate with students using the discussion boards within your student portal, or via CONNECT, Swinburne Online’s very own social networking site. CONNECT is much like an online student lounge, where you can chat with students from across the whole of Swinburne Online. From discussing your course, reflecting on student life, creating face-to-face study groups with students in your local area and even networking for your future, CONNECT is your networking haven.

If you’re studying a TAFE diploma you’ll have access to live chat within Canvas, which allows you to see who else is online at the same time as you and ask other students questions. You can also open up discussions with students and teachers by posting questions to an online discussion board.

          The process for accessing and securing a placement may differ depending on your course, your location and the type of setting.

          Neither the operations nor the teaching period at Swinburne Online have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to operate as business as usual throughout this time of uncertainty, with no reduction in teaching, support or enrolment services. Our intake dates remain unchanged. Swinburne Online is designed to thrive in the online environment. Our experienced support teams and tutors have always effectively worked with our satisfied students from a distance.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          Does the Graduate Certification in Professional Data Analytics prepare me for the Tableau Desktop Certified Specialist certification exam?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          Yes! The Data Analytics for Business unit, which forms part of the Graduate Certificate of Professional Data Analytics, covers the subjects and topics assessed in the Tableau Desktop Certified Specialist certification exam. These include how to:

 	create and explain data connections
 	organise and simplify data
 	create basic charts and visualisations
 	calculate and map data
 	create a dashboard.

While the unit will equip you with the knowledge and skills that are tested on the exam, it is not designed to be direct preparation for the certification and we recommend consulting the Tableau exam guide and free resources, in addition to the unit content, during your preparation.

          We have a whole variety of support options available to students seven days a week, so no one is ever left feeling alone.

For students studying a degree with us, your small online class of 20-24 students is run by a dedicated online tutor (eLearning Advisor), who will always be happy to respond to your questions. Our Student Advisors (SAs) are a team of academic/technical and administrative specialists who can be contacted seven days a week. They can help with issues from advice on assignments to problems with logging in to the Student Portal. We also have online assessment support options that will cater to a range of academic needs.

          A.
          Yes – It’s important that when you enrol, you take note of your desired start date as this will determine the deadline for your fee payment and your Census date. Start dates refer to your course start date (new students), as well as start date options for your next block of units. Census date is your last opportunity to change your enrolment without incurring the cost of your enrolled units.

The Bachelor of Education (Primary), Bachelor of Education (Early Childhood and Primary), Master of Teaching (Primary) and Master of Teaching (Secondary) enable you to register as a teacher anywhere in Australia under mutual recognition. For the Bachelor of Education (Early Childhood Teaching), you should check with the teacher registration authority in your state or territory and course accreditation requirements necessary for any early childhood teacher registration requirements of your state or territory.

You also have the option of completing some placements three consecutive days per week (e.g. Wed, Thurs, Fri) over eight weeks.

          Q.

          A.
          Yes, you can request a student card when you enrol with Swinburne Online. You can use this to borrow books at Swinburne University of Technology’s library or any ULANZ libraries and will also need it when you attend exams.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          Am I eligible for a Commonwealth Supported Place and a HELP loan?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          A Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP) is a subsidised higher education place. You will only pay the student contribution (remaining amount) of the unit fees after the government subsidy has been applied.

A HECS-HELP loan will allow you to defer your fees to a government loan for CSP courses, allowing you to avoid any upfront fees for your course. You would start to pay this loan back once you are earning over the advised threshold. This loan is available to Australian citizens and Humanitarian Visa holders.

A FEE-HELP loan will allow you to defer your fees to a government loan for full fee paying places (non-CSP) allowing you to avoid any upfront fees for your course. You would start to pay this loan back once you are earning over the advised threshold. This loan is available to Australian citizens and Humanitarian Visa holders. You can nominate to defer your fees to a HELP loan during your enrolment, and once you log into your student account that application can be finalised.
        
      
    

                                          
      
        
          Q.
          Am I able to study at Swinburne Online if I don't live in Victoria?
        
      

      
        
          A.
          You can study at Swinburne Online from any state or territory in Australia, as long as you meet the entry requirements for your online course and have an Internet connection!

 	Whether you paid your fees upfront or applied for VET FEE HELP or a VET Student Loan.

Withdrawing before Census: To avoid incurring a VET FEE HELP or VET Student Loan debt (or to receive a full refund if you pay for your fees upfront) you must send your email to Swinburne Online on or before your Census date. We will inform you of your Census dates when you enrol. If you paid your fees upfront, Swinburne Online will send you a refund application form. Once this is processed you will receive a full refund within 10 business days.

Withdrawing after Census: If you withdraw from your course after your Census date, you will be automatically charged for the units you enrolled in. You won’t be able to receive a refund. If you elected for VET FEE HELP or VET Student Loan, you will incur the debt."

 	calculate and map data
 	create a dashboard.

While the unit will equip you with the knowledge and skills that are tested on the exam, it is not designed to be direct preparation for the certification and we recommend consulting the Tableau exam guide and free resources, in addition to the unit content, during your preparation."
